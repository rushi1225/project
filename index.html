      Say Maharashtra and the image of a kilometres-long Marine Drive promenade
      flashes across your mind, quickly followed by the front view of the Gothic
      Victorian structure—Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. Both are famous
      landmarks in Mumbai, the most popular city in Maharashtra. But there is
      more, much more to the third-largest state in India. Pristine beaches,
      surreal hill stations, adventurous treks, strawberry farms, wildlife
      sanctuaries, pilgrimage sites, rich history, scrumptious food and a
      vibrant culture—it has something for everyone.

        memorable experiences it offers. Here’s a comprehensive list of

      Cultural capital of Maharashtra, Pune holds a place of pride in every
      Marathi’s heart. Once a political centre of the Indian sub-continent, Pune
      was the seat of Peshwas of the Maratha Empire. The district alone boasts
      of 17 forts of which the most famous are<b> Shaniwar Wada,</b> Singhagad
      Fort and Purandar Fort, closely followed by a remarkably different looking
      Aga Khan Palace that served as a prison for Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba
      Gandhi soon after he launched the Quit India movement. Pune is a heaven
      for an art, culture and adventure lover.<br /></big

      temple also houses black statues of god Lakshmana and goddess Sita. Nashik
      is one of the four main sites for Kumbh Mela. Held once every 12 years,
