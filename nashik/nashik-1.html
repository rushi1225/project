        Renowned for being one of the 12 jyotirlinga sites, the Trimbakeshwar Temple is among the most revered places to visit on a Nashik tour. It is believed that Lord Shiva appeared as a pillar of light here. The auspicious Kumbh Mela of Nashik takes place around this temple only. Besides its holy ambience, the fact that Trimbakeshwar Temple lies between three hills, namely Nilgiri, Brahmagiri and Kalahari, makes it all the more alluring.
