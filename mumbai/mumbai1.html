      Gateway of India, the best place to visit in Mumbai, was built in 1924 by
      George Willet to honor the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to
      Mumbai. Visit this place in the early morning or late evening hours to
      enjoy the cool breeze of the sea with your family sans the crowd. Located
      next to the iconic Taj Mahal Palace and facing the vast Arabian Sea, the
      Gateway of India leaves you spellbound in every way possible. Take a ferry
      ride offered here to experience a stupendous view of this monument right
      from the sea and you can also visit other main attractions nearby.

      <p>
        And the best part? You don’t have to spend a penny to enjoy the beauty
        of this iconic monument which is often called the Taj Mahal of Mumbai.
        And the city has many such places that you can enjoy free of cost.

      /><br />
      Sprawling over an area of 104 sq. km. of land, this is one of the
      most-visited national parks in Asia and because of this, I give it the 2nd
      spot among all the best places to visit in Mumbai. With all sorts of fun
      activities, this park can surely be a family entertainer. You can watch
      the big cats of the park close enough in a safari cage and have a fun day
      boating in the artificial lake in the park. Take the forest road or stairs
      and hike towards the Gandhi Tekdi, a memorial built in the memory of
      Mahatma Gandhi. The toy train, Van Rani, is another popular attraction
      here, especially among kids. You can also visit the 2000-years-old Kanheri
      Caves to capture the Buddha relics. The undisturbed natural trails and the
      Jain Temple in the forest are also sure to make your visit a memorable
      one.<br />

      Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus is another UNESCO World Heritage Site situated
      right in the heart of Mumbai. Built in the year 1888, during the British
      colonial period, this edifice exemplifies the Victorian-Gothic style of
      architecture. While you are here, don’t forget to take a photograph with
      your family and kids. And guess what, the magnificent CST is the most
      photographed building in India after Taj Mahal!

      <p>
        And once you are done with sightseeing, don’t forget to treat yourself
        and your dear ones to some lip-smacking food. Whether you are looking
        for budget restaurants, fine diners or buffet places, Mumbai has it all.
